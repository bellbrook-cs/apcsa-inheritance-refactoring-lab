# Vehicle Inheritance

## Lab Description

This assignment will last over the next few days, you are free to work ahead. However, I will be covering relevant content every day that may help with that days task.

The end goal of this will be to fix every TODO statement marked in the document. You will be given different goals every class day to serve as that days lab.

At the beginning of every new section, you should fork the current version of your project and continue working. This will make it easier to grade your project as time goes on. You should only submit the relevant version to each days lab.
